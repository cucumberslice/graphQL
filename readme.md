 


In GraphQL, there are three main concepts:

queries — the way you’re going to get data from the server.

mutations — the way you’re going to modify data on the server and get updated data back (create, update, delete).

subscriptions — the way you’re going to maintain a real-time connection with the server.


Queries
To explain this in a simple way, queries in GraphQL are how you’re going to get data. One of the most beautiful things about queries in GraphQL is that you are just going to get the exact data that you want. No more, no less. This has a huge positive impact in our API — no more over-fetching or under-fetching information as we had with REST APIs.

Mutations
In GraphQL, mutations are the way you’re going to modify data on the server and get updated data back. You can think like the CUD (Create, Update, Delete) of REST .
